# Interpretable Learning Approaches in Resting-state Functional Connectivity Analysis
IFC is a repository of codes and experiment results for Research on Interpretable Learning Approaches in Resting-state Functional Connectivity Analysis, using Keras (version 2.2.4) with TensorFlow (version 1.12.0) as backend.
### Publications and cooperation
We are working on some papers about deep learning and interpretation cooperating with Dr. Bin Liao, Prof. Ping Li and others. 

### Codes
The codes would be published soon after the corresponding paper accepted.

### Experiment results
 
#### Classification performance
